# Flower Image Classification using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a simple image classification task using TensorFlow. The goal is to classify images of roses and tulips into their respective categories using a basic neural network implemented with TensorFlow.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
 git clone https://github.com/Maimoonakhan178/Image-Classification-Using-SLP.git

    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Place your flower images in the `flowers` directory, organized into subdirectories for each flower type (e.g., `roses`, `tulips`).

2. Run the `flower_classification.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the images, train the classification model, and evaluate its performance.

3. Modify the notebook or experiment with different hyperparameters to improve the model's accuracy.
